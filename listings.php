					<h4>Setsubun - Final Night of the Winter Lights Festival</h4>
					<p>Time: 6:30-9:30pm</p>
					<p>Location: Nikka Yuko Japanese Garden</p>
					<p><i>regular admission: $6 <br>
					family or group of five: $25</i></p>
					<p>On the final day of the Winter Lights Festival Nikka Yuko celebrates Setsubun, the traditional Japanese day that divides the winter and spring seasons. Setsubun or bean-throwing festival is a celebration to drive away disease and evil spirits before the start of the planting and growing seasons. It is customary to throw roasted soybeans at an oni or demon, thus cleansing the household, temple or shrine for the coming year. 

					Join us for Nikka Yuko Setsubun and yell "oni wa soto! fuku wa uchi!" ("demons out! luck in!) The Garden will be celebrating this evening with seasonal treats and games.
